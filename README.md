# The Conneectors presents a business card sharing app CRDS

## Our Why
> How many of us use business cards?
> How many of us throw away or lose them the moment we get them?
> Ever notice how many steps it takes to share a contact let alone even remembering that contact's services/business/location?

## Some wasteful facts about business cards
About 27 million cards are printed daily, by that around 10 billion cards are printed annually. In contrast of that 10 billion, 8 billion are tossed out within the week they are handed out.

## The Value we intend to bring
* eco-friendly
No need for taking down trees, everything is digital
* Cheaper (by a lot)
50 cards can cost you around $20 depending on the printer. Not to mention sampling and restocking/hiring a graphic designer/adjustments. Long-term it can cost you more than that initial $20 without the flexibility of a digital card.
* Easy to share/Hard to lose
Organize and keep your cards within app, through text/email threads or share on social media!
* Can hold a lot more info than a 3.5 x 2 card
Most business cards are limited to name, email, phone number and address. With our cards you're able to hold all of the above as well as:
website link
social media links
location
and summarize the specific need/value of business!
