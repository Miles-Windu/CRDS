    <p> The recession and non-recovery have made finding that first job out of law school as challenging
         as ever—and that means networking with potential employers is as important as ever. When networking, “At some point in your conversation, 
         they may volunteer to have a longer conversation, or they may say, ‘Hey, send me your résumé, we’re looking for somebody,’”. - Susan C. Robinson
