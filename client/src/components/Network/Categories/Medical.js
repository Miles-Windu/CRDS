    <p> You’ve probably heard the saying “It’s not what you know, but who you know!”
         and this is certainly most evident when it comes to searching for your ideal job.
          In healthcare, because of the technical nature of the role, knowledge and education 
          are naturally necessary, but having connections to help get your foot in the door 
          definitely helps. </p>
