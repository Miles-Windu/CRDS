    <p> Most builders and tradesmen have been invited to business breakfasts at some time or another. Very few attend.
    Every builder likes to say they get a lot of referrals through word of mouth but most are reluctant to belong to a networking
    organisation. Networking is word of mouth. It is the word of mouth of a much greater number of people than you can possibly work for.
